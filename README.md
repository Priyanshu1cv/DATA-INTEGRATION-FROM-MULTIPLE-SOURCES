This interactive Power BI project titled **“Bharat Vyapar Pulse – Sales Dashboard”** was developed during my **4-week internship at CodTech IT Solutions** under the mentorship of **Neela Santosh**.

## 📌 Project Objective

The objective of this project was to analyze sales performance using real-world datasets sourced from multiple origins. The dashboard brings together transactional and master data from:

- **SQL Server** – containing order transactions
- **CSV files** – containing product, customer, and category details
- **Custom image dataset** – mapped to `State` and `Category` columns for visual storytelling

This helped simulate an enterprise-level scenario where data engineers and analysts work across varied data types and formats.

## 🧩 Data Sources Used

The project demonstrates Power BI’s robust data integration capabilities:

- 🔹 **SQL Server** – Live sales transactions (imported into the model)
- 🔹 **CSV Files** – Category master, sub-category info, and customer-region mapping
- 🔹 **Image Dataset (Local Folder)** – Icons for:
  - `State` – Flags or symbolic visuals per region
  - `Category` – Clothing, Electronics, Furniture icons

These images were dynamically embedded into cards, tables, and matrix visuals to create a more intuitive and engaging dashboard.

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights

The dashboard offers:

- **Total Sales**: ₹641.04K
